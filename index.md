## About Me

I'm Ricardo Rei, a Senior Research Scientist at Unbabel leading research on multilingual Large Language Models. My work focuses on LLM evaluation, post-training techniques, and advancing machine translation capabilities across languages.
I recently completed my PhD at Instituto Superior T√©cnico (IST), University of Lisbon, graduating with the distinction of Summa cum laude for my research on machine translation evaluation. My doctoral work was conducted through a collaborative program between Unbabel, IST, and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), known as [Multilingual AI Agents Assistants (MAIA)](https://www.cmuportugal.org/large-scale-collaborative-research-projects/maia/).

**Last update**: 17-04-2025

## Teaching & Mentorship:
Currently co-advise PhD students working on LLM evaluation, post-training, and culturally-informed AI agents.
- [Jos√© Pombal](https://zeppombal.github.io/): Working on LLM evaluation and post-training. He is one of the main authors of Tower LLM.
- **Helena Wu**: Developing Culturally-Informed AI Agent and Personae.
